# Software-development-methodologies-and-technologies-2

This is console application that demonstrates working with a typed list according to the variant.
- Made by student
-Variant -> 21/4 = 5... -> My variant is 1

## Instruction:

# First step

Firstful u need to download Visual studio if u want download all my project or u can just go into [Software-development-methodologies-and-technologies/ConsoleApplication1/ConsoleApplication1
/ConsoleApplication2.cpp] and copy text from cpp file for your compiler

# Second step

Second one u need yml file and file for tests. U can download my project and test it if u do all correct test shows u smth like that: [Test](https://github.com/Wandestes/Software-development-methodologies-and-technologies-2/actions/runs/13674272267)

Dont worry if this shows errors I specifically made a test that shows that it can catch errors and specifically entered incorrect data into the test. (If u see history of [actions](https://github.com/Wandestes/Software-development-methodologies-and-technologies-2/actions) u will see)

# Conclusion

In conclusion, I will say that unit-tests for me were a waste of time and in this case were only the main headache because the compiler shows everything itself and I did not see the need for this. Maybe over time I will change my mind. And so good luck my friends ðŸ˜Š
